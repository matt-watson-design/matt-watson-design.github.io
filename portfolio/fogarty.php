  <p>Fogarty is a sub-brand of Dunelm that specialises in quality, affordable bedding.</p>

<p>This project required a brand new journey to be designed in order to showcase some of the new product photography and unique selling points across the Fogarty range.</p>

<p>The 'Fogarty Sleep Zone' was split into five categories offering tabbed sub-categories within them. This was all built from scratch using HTML/CSS, and utilised jQuery to load in and out the required sub-categories via the interactive tabs.</p>
